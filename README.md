### About Kafka
Kafka is a distributed, fault-tolerant, and high-throughput message broker that can be used to collect and process streams of data in real-time. It is often used as a real-time data pipeline to collect and aggregate data from various sources (such as sensors, logs, and user events) and make it available for downstream processing and analytics.
